Increment the minor version such as `from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0` for implemented features and increment the patch version `from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1` for bug fixes. If any breaking changes occur, increment the major version, like `from 0.1.0 to 1.0.0`. Also see [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/lang/de/)
