**NOTE:** [Steps 4 to 7 in the digits-recognizer-kubeflow GH repository](https://github.com/flopach/digits-recognizer-kubeflow) are not showcased here. These sections focus on saving the ML model in MinIO once the model is successfully built and trained. Furthermore, the trained model is served through KServe's inference HTTP service. The relevant files are:

- [The digits_recognizer_notebook.ipynb for model development and training, which also covers uploading the trained model to MiniO](https://github.com/flopach/digits-recognizer-kubeflow/blob/master/digits_recognizer_notebook.ipynb)
- [create_kserve_inference.yaml for spinning up the KServe inference HTTP service](https://github.com/flopach/digits-recognizer-kubeflow/blob/master/kubeflow_configs/create_kserve_inference.yaml)
- [kserve_python_test.ipynb for testing the Inference KServe HTTP service](https://github.com/flopach/digits-recognizer-kubeflow/blob/master/kserve_python_test.ipynb)
- [digits_recognizer_pipeline.ipynb to setup the ML pipeline](https://github.com/flopach/digits-recognizer-kubeflow/blob/master/digits_recognizer_pipeline.ipynb)

## Getting started

[Github workflows](./.github/workflows/) will be utilized in this Github repository. Once the workflows described in the **Preconditions** and **Deploy an AKS cluster and install the kubeflow or mlflow components** sections have been successfully executed, all resource groups listed should be visible in the Azure Portal UI:

![Deployed resource groups](./images/resource-groups.jpg)
![Deployed cloud-infra resource group](./images/cloud-infra-rg.jpg)

### Preconditions

0. Deploy an Azure Storage Account Service including container for terraform backends trough the [deploy-tf-backend workflow](https://github.com/MGTheTrain/ml-ops-poc/actions/workflows/deploy-tf-backend.yml)

### Deploy an AKS cluster, install the kubeflow or mlflow components or setup kubernetes resources for applications

0. Deploy an AKS trough the [manage-k8s-cluster workflow](https://github.com/MGTheTrain/ml-ops-poc/actions/workflows/manage-k8s-cluster.yml)
1. **Optional:** Install external helm charts (e.g. ml-ops tools) into the deployed kubernetes cluster trough [manage-helm-charts workflow](https://github.com/MGTheTrain/ml-ops-poc/actions/workflows/manage-helm-charts.yml)
2. **Optional:** Deploy kubernetes resources for application (secrets or reverse-proxy ingress) trough [manage-internal-k8s-resources workflow](https://github.com/MGTheTrain/ml-ops-poc/actions/workflows/manage-internal-k8s-resources.yml)

**NOTE:** 
- Set all the required Github secrets for aboves workflows
- In order to locally access the deployed AKS cluster launch the [devcontainer](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) and retrieve the necessary kube config as displayed in the GitHub workflow step labeled with title [Download the ~/.kube/config](https://github.com/MGTheTrain/ml-ops-poc/blob/3f5603fb986f0939be58b8f01b9e0121bde54e3b/.github/workflows/terraform.yml#L82)


### kubeflow

To access the kubeflow dashboard following the installation of kustomize and kubeflow components, execute the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl port-forward -n <namespace>  <pod-name> <local-port>:<server-port>
kubectl port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system 8080:80
```

and visit in a browser of choice `localhost:8080`. 

[Finally, open `http://localhost:8080` and login with the default userâ€™s credentials. The default email address is `user@example.com` and the default password is `12341234`.](https://azure.github.io/kubeflow-aks/main/docs/deployment-options/vanilla-installation/)

#### Jupyter notebooks

When creating the Jupyter notebook instance consider the following data volume:

![Jupyter instance data volume](./images/jupyter-instance-data-volume.PNG)

The volumes that were created appear as follows:

![Jupyter instance created volumes](./images/jupyter-instance-created-volumes.PNG)

The Jypter instace that was created appear as follows:

![Created Jupyter instance](./images/created-jupyter-instance.PNG)

**NOTE:** You can check the status of the Jupyter instance pods:

![Check jupyter instance pods](./images/check-jupyter-instance-pod.PNG)

Once `CONNECTED` to a Jupyter instance ensure to clone this Git repository (HTTPS URL: `https://github.com/MGTheTrain/ml-ops-poc.git`):

![Clone git repository](./images/clone-git-repository.PNG)

You then should have the repository cloned in your workspace:

![Cloned git repository in jupyter instance](./images/cloned-git-repository-in-jupyter-instance.PNG)

Execute a [Jupyter notebook](./notebooks/) to either train the model or perform inference (P.S. It's preferable to begin with the [mnist-trainnig.ipynb](./notebooks/mnist-trainnig.ipynb). Others are either resource intensive or not yet implemented):

![Run jupyter notebook example](./images/run-jupyter-notebook-example.PNG)

#### Applying TFJob or PyTorchJob k8s manifests 

After successful installation of the Kubeflow Training Operator, apply some sample k8s ML training jobs, e.g. [for PyTorch](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/user-guides/pytorch/) and [for Tensorflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/user-guides/tensorflow/).

```sh
# Pytorch (https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/blob/master/examples/pytorch/simple.yaml)
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/training-operator/master/examples/pytorch/simple.yaml
```

```sh
# Tensorflow (https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/blob/master/examples/tensorflow/simple.yaml)
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubeflow/training-operator/master/examples/tensorflow/simple.yaml
```

### mlflow

To access the MLflow dashboard following the installation of the MLflow Helm chart, execute the following command:

```sh
kubectl port-forward -n ml-ops-poc <mlflow pod name> 5000:5000
```

and visit in a browser of choice localhost:5000.

### Destroy the AKS cluster, uninstall helm charts or remove kubernetes resources for applications

0. **Optional:** Uninstall only ml tools of an existing kubernetes cluster trough [manage-helm-charts workflow](https://github.com/MGTheTrain/ml-ops-poc/actions/workflows/manage-helm-charts.yml)
1. **Optional:** Destroy kubernetes resources for application (secrets or reverse-proxy ingress) trough [manage-internal-k8s-resources workflow](https://github.com/MGTheTrain/ml-ops-poc/actions/workflows/manage-internal-k8s-resources.yml)
2. Destroy an AKS trough the [manage-k8s-cluster workflow](https://github.com/MGTheTrain/ml-ops-poc/actions/workflows/manage-k8s-cluster.yml)
